# Professional-Portfolio
Module 2 Challenge

## How I created it
I used HTML and CSS. I looked at previous class sessions and various documents from MDN.

CSS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSShttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model

## issues
I still need to learn how flex wrap, add pictures sizes for the work sections and work on responsive viewport. I need to review classwork again.
